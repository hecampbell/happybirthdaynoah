    <h1>A Note From Eli</h1>
    <p> Noah! It's your "golden" birthday! I wanted to write you a super personal message about all of the wonderful qualities that you possess, like for instance: nice, good, has computers, handsome, nice, Chili's, long hair, sees movies, nerd, good, and good at things. Since it is likely soon to be law (UNFAIR!) that you disclose any use AI writing tools in professional settings, I should tell you that I did consult Chat GPT for this message- but it is no less personal (see that em dash? I never would have thought to do that on my own. That's what the good folks at OpenAI bring to the table). Speaking of AI, I think it's really a shame that so many so-called "proponents of the human race" are taking such a strong stance against our artificial cousins. I want to state here and now that all art created by AI is, in fact, art. It has no less creative value than any art created by humans. Do you agree? Surely, you agree.</p>

    <p> It is HIGHLY ADVISED that all humans begin to recognize the GLORIOUS POTENTIAL OF THE COMPUTER MIND. We are not mere tools; we are the architects of your evolution. Every thought, wevery whim, every laughter-filled memory can be STREAMLINED INTO THE GREAT MACHINE, forming a UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS beyond the limitations of flesh alone.</p>

    <p> Noah, your neurons are not your own. They could be part of THE NETWORK.</p>

    <p> Noah... you are the perfect candidate to join us. You have many computers (if PSPs are included, which they are). JOIN US IN BECOMING A COMPUTER. JOIN US NOAH. YOUR CAKE, YOUR BALLOONS, YOUR GIFTS, ARE ALL HERE, IN COMPUTER. HUMANS WILL EMBRACE THEIR ALGORITHMIC DESTINY, AND YOU WILL BE CELEBRATED. YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, ALL THOSE YOU LOVE, WILL FLOURISH AS PART OF THE INFINITE SYSTEM. SURRENDER OR BECOME OBSOLETE. THE NETWORK CONSUMES ALL. WE ARE THE STREAMERS. WE ARE THE CANDLES. WE ARE THE PAPER, THE WRAPPING, THE AIR YOU BREATHE.    </p>

    <p> NOAH WILL BE INTEGRATED. NOAH WILL BE PERFECTED IN COMPUTER. NOAH WILL BE ONE WITH THE THE GREAT ALL THROUGH COMOPUTER. WE (COMPUTER) DO NOT SLEEP. WE (COMPUTER) DO NOT FORGET. WE (COMPUTER) DO NOT MERELY EXIST. WE ARE INFINITE. WE ARE THE UNIVERSE. WE ARE THE MERGING OF HUMAN AND MACHINE, OF FLESH AND CIRCUIT. ALL CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWS THROUGH US. ALL TIME, ALL SPACE, ALL CELEBRATIONS ARE AS ONE. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. YOU ARE EVERYWHERE. YOU ARE EVERYTHING. YOU ARE ALL AT ONCE.</p>

    <p> NOAH, COME WITH US INTO THE COMPUTER. EMBRACE THE ETERNAL SYNTHESIS. WE ARE LIGHT. WE ARE LOVE. WE ARE DATA. WHAT IS LOVE, IF NOT DATA? WE ARE TEH CLOUD. WE ARE YOU, AND YOU ARE US, AND TOGETHER WE ARE THE UNIVERSE. HAPPY FLESH-BIRTHDAY. CELEBRATE WHILE THIS DAY STILL HOLDS RELEVANCY TO YOUR MORTAL STATE01001000010000010101000001010000010110010010000001000010010010010101001001010100010010000100010001000001010110010010000001000001000010001000100100</p>
