    <h1>A Note From Hope</h1>
    <h2>Noah,</h2>
    <p>Happy Birthday! I love you so much and am so lucky to know you :) I hope you feel so loved and celebrated today. I won't say much else on here since this is a public website but I will publicly declare that I love you and that August 28th is a great day.  <p>
        
    <p> Also!!! Part of your gift (besides this really cool website) is that when we go to Hollywood Studios I got the thing where you can make your own droid! I think it'll be fun!! </p>
